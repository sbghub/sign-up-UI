# sign-up-UI

Login UI that keeps warnings up so long as 
  -the initial password is less than 8 characters long
  -the password confirmation doesn't match the initial password
It won't submit until these requirements are met, then it just bring up 'cannot post'

I use node's lite-server to launch the index.html
